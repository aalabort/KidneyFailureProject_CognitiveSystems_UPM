# KidneyFailureProject_CognitiveSystems_UPM

ML Project to predict patients with Kidney Failure following the whole CRISP-DM approach.

Basically the case is that The Health Analytics department from an European hospital wants to create a system to identify those patients that can suffer kidney complications after a new treatment.

* Available data:
  * Information about near 1000 patients that already finished the treatment.
  * Information regarding the drugs that the patients were also using during the treatment.
    
* Objectives:
  * Decide if the patient will have kidney complications.
  * Most influential variables in having such complications
  * Any other useful information from the analysis of the dataset.
  

The final report in pdf as well as the slides of the final presentation can be found in the "Report.pdf" and the "Kidney Failure Project using the CRISP-DM Methodology.pdf" documents respectively.
